### 12-Factor Compliance

- **#2 Dependencies**: Both `bun.lock` (removed) and `pnpm-lock.yaml` committed
- **#3 Config**: All config via environment variables, validated at startup
- **#5 Build/Release/Run**: Multi-stage Docker build separates concerns
- **#6 Processes**: Stateless server, no local state
- **#7 Port Binding**: PORT configurable via env (default 3000)
- **#9 Disposability**: Graceful shutdown with `enableShutdownHooks()`
- **#10 Dev/Prod Parity**: Same Docker image for all environments
- **#11 Logs**: Structured JSON to stdout, no file logging
- **#12 Admin Processes**: Migration runner scaffold in place
