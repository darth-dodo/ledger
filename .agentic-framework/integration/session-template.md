## Handoff Notes

**Next Session Preparation**

- **Resume Point**: [Where to pick up]
- **Required Persona**: [Recommended persona for next phase]
- **Context Files**: [Files or docs to review]
- **Pending Actions**: [What needs to happen next]

**To Next Agent/Persona**

- **Summary**: [Brief overview of current state]
- **Key Artifacts**: [Files, ADRs, docs created]
- **Open Questions**: [Unresolved items]
- **Quality Status**: [Current gate progress]

**Context Preservation (Serena Memory)**

Session context is persisted using Serena MCP memory operations:

```bash
# Session start — load previous context
list_memories()                                    # See what exists
read_memory("ledger/current-milestone")             # Where are we?
read_memory("ledger/progress")                      # What's done?
read_memory("ledger/blockers")                      # Any blockers?

# During work — checkpoint progress
write_memory("ledger/progress", "M3 Phase 2: HDFC CSV parser complete, ICICI in progress")
write_memory("ledger/decisions", "Chose strategy pattern for bank parsers — see ADR-003")

# Session end — save state for next session
write_memory("ledger/session-summary", "M3 Phase 2 complete. 2/3 parsers working. ICICI pending.")
write_memory("ledger/current-milestone", "M3: Parse & Persist — Phase 2 in progress")
write_memory("ledger/blockers", "None")

# After milestone completion — clean up temporary state
delete_memory("ledger/checkpoint-*")  # Remove transient checkpoints
write_memory("ledger/m3-outcome", "Complete. 3 parsers, 94% test coverage, ADR-003 created.")
```

**Memory key conventions**: `ledger/<topic>` for project state, `ledger/m<N>-<detail>` for milestone-specific notes.
